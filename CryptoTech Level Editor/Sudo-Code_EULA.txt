\b {\listtext	16.	}ENOUGH FROM THE LAWYERS. 
\b0 We\'92s at Sudo-Code Software would also like to thank you for playing/using our software. If on the off-chance you are using this against the terms of the agreement, we prefer you not (that, and it\'92s an offense of EULA). Our coder wanted to have a clause outlining a situation in which he can eat your guts if you pirate the game, we left that out because then we would literally have to eat your guts, get charged with cannibalism and put away in an asylum. So instead, we would like to enforce our legal right to be very disappointed in you, which brings us to our first sub-clause:\
